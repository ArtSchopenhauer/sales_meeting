She and her husband are nearly 90 years old, and she doesn't want to take on anything new.  Mr. Torkelsen was hesitant to move forward in light of his wife's concerns because he feels that they are financially secure with their current financial obligations, and don't necessarily need to save money.  That said, he believes that soon everyone will have solar and he doesn't want to miss a good opportunity.  

I talked with Mr. Torkelsen for awhile about his life and his interests.  He told me a story about a friend of his who built a church in Africa that is run entirely on solar, which provides the only energy available in the area.  It was this friend who first interested him in solar.  I used this story to highlight the benefits of solar, and explained the enormous environmental benefit that will be produced by his array.  We compared photos of my children and his grandchildren, and I shared my belief that going solar would be a very special legacy for us to leave behind for the next generation.  

After a long discussion, including some questions he had about my personal feelings about this company, Mr. Torkelsen decided he wanted us to install the system, and his wife agreed as long as her husband agreed to take full responsibility for working with Level as the process moves forward.  

They do not have a land survey for the property.  They informed me that surveys for this community are all on file with the town.

The customer wants to make sure that the inverter will be able to fit next to his meter.  I assured him that our team would make sure the design plan accommodated his needs before install.  Ideally, he would like the inverter to be located to the right of his meter, between the meter and the railing.",2016-01-31 19:00:00.000000,2016-02-07 19:00:00.000000,Yes,None

I worked through the numbers with him to illustrate how he could never achieve the level of savings with ownership that he will with the PPA.  I showed him how that, combined with the increased insurance costs, potential cost of maintenance, and likely replacement costs for the inverter over time eliminated most of his potential for savings over 20 years.  Once it was explained to him, he agreed that the PPA was the best plan for him.

He was still going to postpone because he wants to replace his roof before the panels are installed.  Vivint, on the day of his scheduled installation, told him his roof wasn't structurally sound and that they could not install.  I told him that there were no indications of those problems from our engineers, but he would still like to replace the roof first to avoid the $400 cost to remove and replace the array.  I suggested that, instead of canceling his agreement with us, we move forward with the process, obtain permits, but postpone his installation for a few months so he can complete the roof work.  That way, he would be locked in to the rates, and we would be prepared to install as soon as the work is completed.  He agreed that this was a good plan and agreed to move forward.  

Permitting:  The customer told me that his Vivint permit has already been closed.  Also, he already has a net meter that was installed prior to Vivint canceling.",2016-01-14 19:00:00.000000,2016-02-23 19:00:00.000000,No,None

Due to the scheduling issue we missed his wife (she had to go to work) so it was a one-legger. 

Aside from not being able to make a decision without his wife present, he also expressed that the 20 year commitment was the biggest hold up. Asking him questions about why this was a reservation helped me to determine his logic for saying this.

When he and I met on 1/18/16 he had asked for some time to discuss the design with his wife, and he was waiting to receive a design from Solar City to compare to ours.  

He received the Solar City design, which was producing less power than we proposed.  We are producing 105% of his energy.  

He shared with me that he and his wife discussed both proposals and decided that the savings wasn't worth moving forward.  He wants to wait until solar can reduce his monthly bill by at least $200-$300.  I explained that those numbers are not a realistic expectation, and that in the future, once the tax incentives are reduced, solar rates are likely to increase, rather than decrease.  I also reminded him that the first year savings represents the lowest that his savings will be for the entire 20 years.  

I also shared with him that the financial savings is only one component of massive benefit of solar.  I highlighted the environmental impact, but that is not a consideration for this customer.

Unfortunately, I was not able to change his mind and he has decided to cancel the process and not move forward.

He is not the homeowner.  Mrs. Perry, the homeowner, was not available to meet today.  She is at work.

Although he is not the homeowner, Mr. Perry says that the decision regarding solar will be primarily his.  They are meeting with 5 companies and intend to compare the programs and designs before making a final decision.  

We are producing 102% of their power, compared with Solar City who is only producing 83% of their power.  He has not yet received designs from the other companies.  All meetings are within the next 10 days.

Mr. Perry was not aware that they would be paying for the monthly production.  It was his understanding that his payment would be the same every month.  He currently pays $189/month to PSEG on balanced billing.  I explained that balanced billing was a false representation of his actual costs, and demonstrated that for 8 out of 12 months his bill from Level Solar would be less than $189 based on the estimated monthly production.  The only time the costs would exceed that number would be in the summer months due to high production that accommodates high consumption during those months.  When I illustrated the annual savings with solar he was extremely disappointed.  He had been led to believe he would be saving thousands of dollars, which is obviously unrealistic.  This led him to suggest that leasing would be the better program for him, but I highlighted several of the disadvantages of leasing and showed him how the costs would actually be higher than with a PPA.  

He was under the impression that the homeowner would receive the utility tax credit in addition to the NYS Tax Credit.  When I shared with him that Level Solar received the utility incentive he got frustrated and said that he wasn't given that information at the initial consultation.  Also, when I explained that he would need to have a tax liability to NYS in order to take advantage of the NYS tax credit he accused me of using the tax credit as a ""marketing ploy"".  I was able to diffuse the situation by showing him that we were actually the only company to be truthful about the tax credit, when all the others had led him to believe he would be able to collect that money as if it were a rebate.

He shared with me that he and his wife plan to sell their home in 3 years when his wife retires.  He was concerned about the transferability of the PPA.  I explained the easy process involved and he was satisfied with that.

At the end of our meeting Mr. Perry said that he was seriously considering Level Solar.  He has a few other meetings in the next 10 days so he asked us to call him to follow up at the end of next week.  

If someone at HQ handles the follow up, please make sure that Michelle Perry will be available for the follow up meeting.  Evidently, the other solar companies told him that, even though he is not the homeowner, he could sign all the required documents.  I explained to him why it was necessary for the homeowner to be present for the meeting, but please reaffirm the importance of this when you speak with him.",,,No,None

They are very numbers focused based on the fact that they are both accountants.

Another thing against us was the fact that it's tax season and Mr. Darson and Mr. Darson is an accountant so he couldn't stay long.  Mrs. Darson and I continued to talk and the appointment lasted an hour and a half.  

With both homeowners I did my utmost best to stress our global mission of helping the environment. And also focusing on the fact that the way they are purchasing their electric is from a monopoly that is using a variable pricing system. And also, the company makes them pay more when they use less.  I compared this to a legal mafia.  Mrs. Darison liked this analogy a lot.  I stressed to them that the number of savings is not what's most important.   That also there home value will go up immediately...  I explained that if we come back with a number that was 4 as opposed to 6 for savings then this should not matter because before we met the number for savings was zero.  I explained to Mr. Darson that the smartest investment is an infinite return on your investment, which he will get from our program.  Mr. Darson Agreed.   

After Mr. Darson left to work more on his business I leveraged Level's values to Mrs.  Darison.  I explained to her that we are here to thrive in many more markets and that this is an amazing company to be apart of with a track record of countless euphoric customers.  I advised her to look at our reviews if she hasn't done so yet.

After speaking to Mrs. Darson for an hour about solar/life I did notice a change in heart in her and that before hand she may not have been thinking of all the benefits that solar has to offer.  She agreed to a second appointment with us after the tax season. 

Another faster solution is if we can add more panels to roof 3 or 4 then they will deffinitly go solar with us.  Can we please research more into if this ? I would love to for them to be our next raving fans, and I'm confident we can earn their business.",,,No,None

I went over buy and lease and why a PPA is far better and he finally understood and said he wants to only do the PPA. He was very stuck on going with scty but said he likes us much better now. 

After having AD do a 3rd design change while I was in the home, he finally accepted our proposal. He asked how he can cancel with scty and how we apply for a permit with us.  I told him I'll need to get the letter for him to sign to cancel their permit and we need the power clerk signed but first off he needs to cut down his tree, so I told him to do that as soon as he could. 

I got him to sign town docs for now but will have to go back with the letter and power clerk. He just wanted to talk to scty today before he fully commits with us and said he'd call back in the next couple of days. 

I will personally follow up with him on Friday if he doesn't call me back first. He should be G2G at that time and I will set a time to revisit and finalize everything.

Jim and Cara were a very cool couple. They are so excited to be going solar. They loved that we are giving them 103% and that their system will be symmetrical and perfect. This will be a great install to showcase when completed. 

Jim got home after I explained everything to Cara so while he was gone she expressed how Jim was very skeptical because of his friend that got solar and had a horrible experience. She said they had such major leaking and flooding issues that it resulted in them having to gut the entire living room and repair all walls, floors and replace furniture. She also told me that they dropped a ladder on top of their friends new truck and did an illegal electrical job that they were trying to get away with. That company has since been bought out by NRG. 

When Jim got home he shared the same story and was naturally very hesitant for good reason, but I reassured him that our quality is top notch, that we don't cut corners, that we do everything legal and by the book and that our work has to comply to pass inspection, also that we don't sub contract anything, our installers and electricians are the best in the business and do the cleanest jobs, and that our systems look amazing! I also hyped up our permitting process, our customer service, referral program, etc.
 
By the end of that they were super stoked to go solar and Jim has 2 of his friends at Petro that will be calling Richard Kahn for solar. 

The only other thing Jim wanted to make sure of is that we aren't instilling in the cold weather. He doesn't want his shingles to crack in the cold weather. I told him that the permit will take about 6 weeks anyway (putting them into April) before we can even install. He was okay with this and said April or May install is perfect.

They were disappointed that they will not be receiving 100% of their power.  They had expected that would be the case.  I explained that 100% coverage is not typical and that the 63% they are receiving is actually fantastic.  I shared the financial and environmental benefits, and highlighted the enormous impact their system will have on their economic stability, and the local environment.  They conceded that there are sizable benefits, but reaffirmed that we did not meet their expectations.

We had a discussion regarding PSEG rates.  Mrs. Mills says that she does not think that PSEG rates are likely to increase very much in the future.  I shared with her the historic trends and we all agreed that, in cases like this, history tends to accurately predict the future.

They met with Vivint last week, and want to delay a final decision until they have had the opportunity to compare both proposals.  Ultimately, they want to choose the company who is able to provide the highest percentage of their annual energy consumption.  I shared with them the fact that, because Vivint's rates increase more quickly than ours do, even if they were to produce slightly more energy, the savings would still be less over 20 years.  They agreed that this is likely, but they don't feel comfortable making a decision without seeing both proposals.

He shared many of the same concerns he did at our initial consultation.  He is extremely apprehensive about making a final decision on any home improvement until his divorce is farther along.  I can personally relate to the situation he is in, so we spent some time discussing the options, including moving forward with applying for building permits so that he could lock in to the rates, but delaying the installation by several months.  

Ultimately, Anthony is much too uncomfortable in his current situation to make a decision about solar.  He wants to go solar, and clearly articulated the benefits and value the solar would bring for him, but he is under too much pressure from forces beyond his control to move forward right now.

This was a tough one! I asked what their expectation on savings were and he said if I can't cut my bill in half then it's not worth it. I then did a hard takeaway and told him that solar probably isn't the best thing for them and told him that the max first year is someone that gets 100% of power from solar and may be around 20-25% savings first year. This was shocking to him but he asked me to stay and proceed with what he have to offer. 

I then went over our design of offsetting 37% of their power and asked the reasons for such high usage. After conversing about their usage I showed them the savings and set the expectation that this is step one and that step two would be to reduce usage so they save more money. I gave them pointers on reducing vampire loads and going LED in all lights and this was received very well. After 2 hours of talking they excitedly signed the documents to move forward. 

This was a Vivinit takeaway where they had a bad experience. Let's make sure they receive our classic A+ service going forward. 

Vivint did apply for and receive a permit but the finnerty's just received a notice that it expired so we should be good to go with applying for our permit. 

Vivint also applied for the net meter which has been installed for almost a year now. They are already off balanced billing and know that it will stay that way. 

This is an awesome couple that is excited to do what they can to try and save more. Despite initial concerns of resale value and savings, they now see the long term value of solar and are no longer worried about transferring at time of sale.

Tim owns a fabrication company and is hyper-focused on numbers.  He spent nearly an hour modeling out our program and comparing it to Solar City who had offered him a fixed rate of $0.21/kWh.  After doing all of the calculations, he proclaimed that our program saved him nearly $8,000 more than Solar City would over the next 20 years.  

He asked every single question I've ever heard from a customer, and shared every single concern I've ever seen.  I initially tried to highlight the benefits, but it was clear that he needed a specific response to each question and concern so we went through them one by one.  

Once I had overcome his questions and concerns, his wife, who he originally said was not joining us, called on the phone and shared another 25 minutes of questions and concerns.  Ultimately, she admitted that her primary concern is the appearance of the panels.  At this point Tim began presenting his ideas for manufacturing a product that would conceal solar panels from view.  

After an exhaustive conversation that addressed every topic I've ever experienced since I began working here, Tim decided that we were the best option for him.  

Tim asked me to convey his desire to meet with Richard one on one to discuss his ideas for manufacturing a product that would conceal solar panels on the roof.  I explained that I did not have the authority to speak for the company, so he said he is going to call HQ in the coming days so that he can arrange ""15 minutes"" in front of Richard.  I will say that Tim's ideas are intriguing and worth listening to.  

Tim pays all of his bills from an account that is managed by his assistant.  He does not have access to the bank account information.  He promised to call HQ tomorrow and provide the information we need for ACH.

I arrived with two designs. The first one is what we could actually do, the second one is what would be possible if trees were removed. 

After much deliberation over nearly 2 hours, they decided that they didn't want either design. The reason is because they can't control the removal of the back tree in their neighbors yard. 

They would like us to do another design assuming only the one tree in the front is removed and the back tree staying. Essentially we need to mesh the two designs together by designing for the entire front roof covered with the proposed 29 panels on one design and the proposed 13 panels on the back roof on the other design. If we can do this they would be happy to move forward. 

They both did mention some apprehension with the way our system looks. They stopped by the 3 homes that Elliott told them to visit and they were very disappointed with the way our system looks. They thought the raised clamps in between our panels were ugly and they also hated how they could see the footings from the side. I told them that we could easily paint the footings that show on the side. This was a satisfactory solution to them, but they just hate the look of them being bumpy looking because of our mounts. They said they liked the smooth look of solar city's panels better. After showing them lots of pictures of our installs, they felt they all looked really nice.  The one home they visited in person just made them hate the look of our system. I think they are okay with it now after I told them how clean our electrical work is, how we use a more efficient panel, how we use black mono panels instead of the bluish colored poly panels. They like these features a lot and said they could live with our system if we can paint the visible footings black and paint the conduit to match the roof shingles.
