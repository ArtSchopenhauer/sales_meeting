1,George Tvelia,0033900001vvQVcAAM,Suffolk,2016-01-07 12:33:15.000000,goodtogo,"This was a follow up visit because the customer had called in to postpone after he was originally GTG with Sarah.  The customer was disputing the engineering measurements that indicated he would need to remove a large tree from his yard before we could add an additional 10 panels to his design.  He took me outside to explain why he felt we had made an error, but when I explained that the measurements were the result of a combination of roof slope, shading, and orientation he relented and agreed to move forward with the original design.  He is not willing to remove the tree because it is more than 100 years old and gives character to his yard.  This is now a solid GTG."
2,Joshua Lilly,0033900001vx9CSAAY,Suffolk,2016-01-07 13:06:25.000000,postponed,Josh is removing some trees that are shading his roof so that we can install more panels.  Postpone until this Spring.
3,Tom Kirrane,0033900001vxlFTAAY,Nassau,2016-01-07 13:49:36.000000,designchange,"There is a whole part of their house with a N/S facing roof that was not surveryed, it's not even on the survey of their house with the array design.
Please have SS go out to measure that roof.

They also have a leak in their roof that they want to try and fix."
4,Joan Lynch,0037000001vZRniAAG,Nassau,2016-01-07 16:01:39.000000,moretime-complete,"She is G2G but has a tree she is taking down. This will happen soon, and she said she will contact me when it is down.

Very cute older woman who is doing this mainly for the environment and has been putting money aside each paycheck since the first time she talked to me in order to afford to cut the tree causing the problem down."
5,Daniel Ciano,0033900001vxiyKAAQ,Suffolk,2016-01-07 18:04:38.000000,goodtogo,"There is not enough space next to the meter to put the inverter, he would like Shawn to call him and explain how the they are going to connect the inverter to the meter and breaker box (he's a young guy and an electrician and seems like he thinks he knows everything fyi).

Currently the deed is in Daniel's moms name. Should be resolved soon and put in Daniel's name."
6,Raymond Balsam,0033900001vxmVuAAI,Suffolk,2016-01-07 21:26:49.000000,goodtogo,"They were surprised to learn that their front roof was the most efficient, but they are comfortable with the design because of the way we install the panels.  

They said that Josh was extremely thorough so they had very few residual questions.  I confirmed for them that we own and maintain the panels for 20 years, and that we would be responsible for repairing or replacing the panels should anything go wrong.  

They had recently met with Vivint, but haven't received a design from them.  I explained the difference between our annual escalator and Vivint's, and also described the difference in the way we install the panels.  They are extremely comfortable with us.

They expect to have many referrals for Josh because several of their neighbors are waiting to see how their experience is with us before they make a decision to go solar."
7,Norman Seastedt,0033900001vxtXVAAY,Nassau,2016-01-08 13:07:34.000000,goodtogo,"Really cute 88 year old man who likes the idea of going solar. I estimated his usage for him based on what he pays and the bar graph on PSEG's bill and it looks like he uses about 2,700kWh/yr, so we can install the 3,000kWh system, he is fine with that. I used the PSEG energy calculator and it said he uses closer to 9,000kWh/yr, and that is definitely more than what he uses.

He is excited to go solar!"
8,William Trinceri,0033900001vwsFqAAI,Suffolk,2016-01-08 17:23:25.000000,goodtogo,"The customer and his wife were hesitant to move forward at first because they were uncomfortable with the fact that the production of the system can't be reduced in the future if their consumption changes.  I spoke with them for awhile and determined that they do not anticipate their lifestyle to change significantly, so it is unlikely that their consumption would change.  I explained that, although we could install fewer panels, the result would be them paying PSEG for additional electricity and rates that increase at an uncontrollable rate.  They agreed.

They shared with me that another company that they did not wish to name had designed a system with panels only on the front of the home, whereas our system is on both the front and back sides.  I explained that it was likely that the other company would not be producing 100% of their power, but we are.  

Mr. Trinceri explained that he and his wife are the ""guinea pigs"" on the block, and that other neighbors could be expected to follow their example."
9,Lissette Munoz,0037000001urRifAAE,Nassau,2016-01-08 18:44:24.000000,goodtogo,Really nice couple who finally decided to move forward :)
10,Debra Forgione,0033900001vxVMHAA2,Suffolk,2016-01-08 18:55:16.000000,goodtogo,"A great couple excited to go solar.  Debra's husband was initially very skeptical of the value of moving forward based in their level of savings, and the fact that we are only producing 50% of their power.  I spent some time explaining that their energy consumption is unusually high and that they had tremendous potential for additional savings if they reduce their consumption simultaneously with going solar.  I also pointed out that since there is no cost to them under our program, the savings they will see is entirely free money.  Debra agreed, and her husband ultimately conceded the point.  

They are planning to sell their home within five years so Debra had some concerns regarding the impact solar might have on their resale value, but I shared the benefits of increased value, and that the new homeowner would be taking advantage of the low rates she and her husband locked into now.  On this point, Debra said she trusted me and asked me whether I felt this was a good move for them.  Based on my encouragement, she decided to move forward.  

I was able to obtain the missing rafter photos, however the only access to the rafters is over the garage.  The main roof rafters are sealed.  It's likely that the rafter structure is identical for the entire home, but I explained to the customer that we might still need to send an architect to certify the main roof.  Please advise me whether this is the case.  

Thank you!"
11,Rajeshwar Sharma,0033900001vxCYIAA2,Nassau,2016-01-09 11:10:22.000000,goodtogo,"Nice couple who are excited to go solar! 

Their friend sat in on the presentation and is interested, but wants to talk to his cousin who owns his own system first. He has my and Neal's cards so he will call when he's ready to move forward with us. Currently he's looked into nrg and doesn't like them."

They chose the larger design producing 12,800 kWh. 

Robert Taylor (husband) is a handyman by trade and will repair his roof ridge vent next week. This doesn't prohibit us from submitting permits. 
He will take pictures of the repair and email or text them to me or Anthony next week. 

They are excited to go solar :)"
18,Phyllis Caliendo,0033900001vy0H2AAI,Suffolk,2016-01-10 18:55:18.000000,goodtogo,These are my inlaws (referred by me! :)) and they are excited to go solar!
19,Thomas C. Doughty,0033900001vxzTGAAY,Suffolk,2016-01-11 11:44:15.000000,goodtogo,"Customer is thrilled that we are producing 100% of his power.

He has some concerns regarding the installation.  He wants to make sure that the conduit from the panels to the inverter is hidden as well as possible against the white trim of his home.  He looked at Eric Seigneuray's home and didn't like the way the conduit was exposed on that home.  Please make sure we work with the customer to ensure that the installation meets his expectations.

Mr. Doughty has been extremely satisfied with his experience with Level Solar so far.  He has invested in pre-revenue companies in the past, and would like to know if we are accepting venture capital at this time.  I told him I would get back to him.

GTG."
20,Naciye Kirman,0033900001vxkUNAAY,Suffolk,2016-01-11 17:05:36.000000,cancel,"VERY disappointed we didn't put panels on roof 1. I explained to them that it has too shallow of a pitch and the problems that that can cause, but they do not want to move forward unless panels are put on that roof.

I tried to tell them how any savings is a good savings and it is good for the environment but they want to look into other companies to see if they can offer a design with panels on roof 1. She said she sees sun all the time there and will only accept a design with panels there.

Unfortunately I don't think there is anything whe can do since it is a pitch issue."
21,Lars Torkelsen,0033900001wI439AAC,Suffolk,2016-01-12 11:54:27.000000,goodtogo,"This was a challenging meeting because Mrs. Torkelsen started the meeting by saying that she wanted absolutely nothing to do with solar.  She and her husband are nearly 90 years old, and she doesn't want to take on anything new.  Mr. Torkelsen was hesitant to move forward in light of his wife's concerns because he feels that they are financially secure with their current financial obligations, and don't necessarily need to save money.  That said, he believes that soon everyone will have solar and he doesn't want to miss a good opportunity.  

I talked with Mr. Torkelsen for awhile about his life and his interests.  He told me a story about a friend of his who built a church in Africa that is run entirely on solar, which provides the only energy available in the area.  It was this friend who first interested him in solar.  I used this story to highlight the benefits of solar, and explained the enormous environmental benefit that will be produced by his array.  We compared photos of my children and his grandchildren, and I shared my belief that going solar would be a very special legacy for us to leave behind for the next generation.  

After a long discussion, including some questions he had about my personal feelings about this company, Mr. Torkelsen decided he wanted us to install the system, and his wife agreed as long as her husband agreed to take full responsibility for working with Level as the process moves forward.  

They do not have a land survey for the property.  They informed me that surveys for this community are all on file with the town.

The customer wants to make sure that the inverter will be able to fit next to his meter.  I assured him that our team would make sure the design plan accommodated his needs before install.  Ideally, he would like the inverter to be located to the right of his meter, between the meter and the railing."
23,Anthony Sorrentino,0033900001wILf5AAG,Suffolk,2016-01-13 12:52:45.000000,goodtogo,"When I first arrived, Mr. Sorrentino told me that he was pretty sure he wanted to purchase panels instead so that he could avoid a 20 year commitment to a company.  I worked through the numbers with him to illustrate how he could never achieve the level of savings with ownership that he will with the PPA.  I showed him how that, combined with the increased insurance costs, potential cost of maintenance, and likely replacement costs for the inverter over time eliminated most of his potential for savings over 20 years.  Once it was explained to him, he agreed that the PPA was the best plan for him.

He was still going to postpone because he wants to replace his roof before the panels are installed.  Vivint, on the day of his scheduled installation, told him his roof wasn't structurally sound and that they could not install.  I told him that there were no indications of those problems from our engineers, but he would still like to replace the roof first to avoid the $400 cost to remove and replace the array.  I suggested that, instead of canceling his agreement with us, we move forward with the process, obtain permits, but postpone his installation for a few months so he can complete the roof work.  That way, he would be locked in to the rates, and we would be prepared to install as soon as the work is completed.  He agreed that this was a good plan and agreed to move forward.  

Permitting:  The customer told me that his Vivint permit has already been closed.  Also, he already has a net meter that was installed prior to Vivint canceling."
24,Robert Mezack,0033900001wILjgAAG,Nassau,2016-01-13 13:47:16.000000,moretime-incomplete,"He would like to wait to move forward until damage caused by site survey is finished. He understands that in this cold weather that the shingles get brittle, but he still wants to make sure we repair his roof.

Seeman is planning on going to repair it on Friday, please follow up with him any time next week because his roof will be repaired by then."
25,Kevin Yu,0033900001wIC6MAAW,Nassau,2016-01-13 18:34:57.000000,goodtogo,Very excited to go solar and save some money!
26,Adrianne Moreno,0037000001uqjWVAAY,Suffolk,2016-01-13 19:42:09.000000,goodtogo,"Mrs. Moreno was extremely anxious about this meeting.  She started the meeting apologizing for her level of stress because she said that Steve was ""sensational, and extremely patient"" and that he had addressed all her concerns and answered all of her questions.  She said that she had spoken to several friends who discouraged her from moving forward, and had some issues that she didn't think she was going to be able to overcome.  

First, she was confused about the rates.  She thought that the rates were going to increase 1.7 cents every year, rather than 2.4%.  She said that Steve had showed her a chart explaining the rates, but she did not retain the information.  I showed her on a calculator how the rates increased a fraction of a cent each year, rather than what she had originally thought.  

She had additional concerns ranging from insurance coverage, to home resale value, to technical questions about how the panels actually produced electricity.  She had been led to believe by friends that purchasing the panels from Home Depot was a much better option so I spent some time explaining the reasons why a PPA benefits her much more than ownership.  

Finally, she explained the issue that she felt could not be overcome.  She recently had a pipe burst in her home and is in the process of hiring a contractor to make repairs.  She cannot handle the idea of managing the repairs at the same time as she is moving forward with the solar installation.  She understands that we take care of the permitting process, but she would be emotionally overwhelmed by both processes simultaneously.  She wants to move forward, but she is very anxious.  I explained that the permitting process will take several weeks, and that, if her repairs have not been completed by the time we receive the permit, we could postpone for a few weeks while she finishes repairs.  When I proposed this option, she took a deep breath, and said that this was the first time she didn't feel anxious about the solar.  She knows that going solar is the right thing to do, and she does not want to miss this opportunity, but she needed to know that she would not have to deal with the installation at the same time as her other repairs.  

We spoke for over an hour and a half, and ultimately she felt comfortable moving forward.  I shared with her that she and I are neighbors (I live around the corner) which also helped her feel more comfortable.  

When we receive her permit, please call her and ask how the repairs are coming along.  She is easily overwhelmed, and I promised her that we would hold her hand through this process.  I also promised her that Steve and I would be available at any time if she had additional concerns.  If we work with her, this will be a success story."
28,Kenneth K Dean,0033900001wILJBAA4,Suffolk,2016-01-14 11:35:27.000000,moretime-incomplete,Loves everything just wants to run it by his wife before making a final decision.  Said to expect a call next thursday.

Wonderful couple that was turned away by Vivint. Shawn was able to verify that their electrical was all good and they are looking forward to get a bigger and better system than what Vivint was providing. 

All around this was a great takeaway."

This couple is very excited for solar even though they are big users. 

He mentioned that his neighbor had to legalize their hot tub and told me he has a hot tub also. I made sure that he was willing to legalize the hot tub if the town requires it and he affirmatively said he's happy to pay the fee to get it legalized if needed. 

Other than that, he said we are good to submit permits and that he looks forward to saving money and going green."
34,Laurette Gregory,0033900001wIWNlAAO,Nassau,2016-01-14 19:00:56.000000,moretime-incomplete,"Such a cool woman who likes us a lot, gave all of Brandond's cards our already, and really wants to go solar with us but has an unpermitted deck and can't afford for her taxes to increase. I'm going to talk to Gabby about it and give Laurette a call tomorrow. Hopefully the plan is she will come to the office of Tuesday to sign the town docs (she wants to come by)"
36,Carol Moccio,0033900001wIQPWAA4,Suffolk,2016-01-15 17:17:07.000000,goodtogo,"Thrilled with their design and overwhelmed by the number of panels.  Their house is fully electric so this is going to make a tremendous impact on their expenses.  

They had some questions about the benefits of a PPA vs purchasing, and wanted to make sure this would be helpful when they want to sell their home.  They were excited to see the positive impact they are going to have."
37,Peter Hilbert,0037000001vb6khAAA,Suffolk,2016-01-15 19:27:38.000000,goodtogo,"I met with this couple before the break, but they needed more time to make a final decision.  At the time, they were waiting to see a design from Vivint, and Mr. Hilbert didn't want to make a final decision before seeing what both companies had to offer.  They were extremely disappointed with their Vivint experience, and called me this week to say they were ready to move forward with us.  

The Hilberts thanked me for allowing them the time to get comfortable with their decision, and shared with me that they are extremely excited to be moving forward now.  The fact that we were willing to give them time to consider their options, as well as the level of service we have been providing compared to Vivint, ultimately won the day.  Nicely done, everyone."
38,Paul Augello,0033900001vwtlBAAQ,Suffolk,2016-01-15 22:08:15.000000,goodtogo,"This was an extremely challenging meeting.  Mr. Augello had been extremely skeptical from the beginning, and made it clear to Josh that it was going to take a lot for him to be comfortable moving forward.  Tonight, he started our meeting by informing me that there was no chance that he would be moving forward tonight.  He said that he had decided to purchase the panels, and did not want any part of the PPA.

I came prepared with two design options.  The first was a design that maximized the roof and produced 100% of the customer's consumption for the past 12 months.  The second was a design that included panels only on the back and west side of the home, that would produce 7,500kWh/annually because the customer told Josh he was making changes to his CAC system that would reduce his energy consumption to about 10,000kWh/annually and did not want to produce more than that.  I presented both designs to the customer, and explained the rationale behind both, but has was satisfied with neither.  

The first challenge was overcoming his insistence upon purchasing his own panels.  I spent a lot of time explaining the reasons why purchasing would not be a better option for him.  He was very attached to the idea of owning his own system, and he also felt that $0.15/kWh was more than he was willing to pay for electricity.  It took about 25 minutes, but after I explained that the PPA followed the same model of energy purchase that he had been accustomed to with PSEG (paying for power, instead of a power plant) he relented and agreed that the PPA actually seemed like the better plan.  

Once we overcame the purchase vs PPA objection, we moved on to his concerns about the actual design.  He currently uses about 12,000kWh/annually, but is upgrading his CAC system and believes he will only use 10,000kWh moving forward.  He did not want to accept the maximized design that would produce 12,000kWh, but also did not feel comfortable settling for the design producing 7,500kWh.  Mr. Augello asked if it would be possible to remove the landscape panels from the front of his home, but leave the portrait oriented panels.  I called HQ and spoke with Lennon who made the change while we were on the phone, determining that the change would result in a system producing 9,600kWh/annually.  Mr. Augello was very pleased with that number, and impressed with our ability to make the change in real time.  Lennon emailed me the updated design and the PowerClerk, which we printed in the customer's home.  (HQ did not have the ability to generate a docu-sign form)

Even after all this effort, Mr. Augello said that, although he was now very comfortable with the system and convinced that the PPA would be the right move for him, he still wanted to take a few days to make a final decision.  I asked him what lingering concerns were making him hesitate, and he shared with me that he simply does not sign paperwork on the day he makes a decision.  I told him that I could completely respect and relate to that feeling because I often feel the same way.  I started asking him about his family, and we talked about our children for awhile.  After we had been talking for a few minutes, hile I was showing him pictures of my daughter and son, he reached for the paperwork and asked me where he could sign.  He said that he would never have believed he would be comfortable moving forward tonight, but he is.  

The only document he would not sign was the ACH authorization.  He does not feel comfortable putting his account information on the form or giving us a voided check, but he agreed to call HQ and give them the information over the phone.  So as not to jeapordize the comfort he had developed, I agreed to this.

PERMITTING:  Please make sure that we apply for permits using the design that is producing 9,600kWh/annually and has only one row of portrait oriented panels on the front of the home."

They didn't understand that they would he paying for production versus consumption, so they were under the impression that they could reduce or increase the production of the system based upon their future needs.  I clarified their understanding and they realize that they will be paying for what the system produces.  

Mrs. Colon would like a Level Solar jacket.  I told her I couldn't make any promises, but that I would pass the message along.  :)"

47,Anthony Randisi,0033900001wIet4AAC,Suffolk,2016-01-19 12:35:49.000000,goodtogo,"I originally met with this couple of January 15th, but they asked for some more time to research our company.  

They are extremely happy with their design since we are the only company able to install panels on the front of their home, which allows them to reach 100% production.  They consulted the BBB and Solar Reviews website and were extremely satisfied with what they found.  They also spoke with a friend who had purchased panels, and he strongly discouraged him from purchasing.  All of these factors, combined with their total satisfaction with their experience with us led them to their final decision.

They had some concerns regarding the panels being on the front of their home, but decided with very little guidance that it is well worth the level of energy production they'd are receiving.  

Mr. Hardalo was completely against ACH payment.  We spent some time discussing this.  He agreed that the alternative options were not worth the $7.50/month penalty he would be charged.  I explained that ACH is actually the most secure form of payment, so he agreed to move forward.

53,Alan Norrby,0033900001wnJ60AAE,Suffolk,2016-01-21 13:08:57.000000,goodtogo,"This was a challenging situation.  Although Mr. Norrby was pleased with the fact that we are producing 100% of his power, he was very disappointed at the level of savings.  He understands that savings increases over time, but he kept saying that he didn't think the savings was worth having the solar panels on the front of his house.  

He and I talked through several of his concerns including resale value, insurance and maintenance, and whether or not PSEG would accurately track his energy credit bank.  Once we overcame those issues, he returned to the issue of savings.  It took nearly an hour, but I was able to convince him that now was the right time to go solar, and that this is the right program for him.  I shared my belief that the financial savings, although impressive, are only part of the benefit, and that the environmental impact he will make going solar is an impressive legacy to leave behind for the next generation.  Ultimately, he said he could not argue those points and agreed to move forward."

Hey guys unfortunately Frank Farina is no longer going solar not because he doesn't want to but because of C.O. issues.  He knew this might be a problem so he went to the town and for him to clear everything up it would cost him a few thousand dollars.  He still is gonna work on giving us referrals and had nothing but good things to say about us."

She does have an open permit for her patio (she found out about it when she went to get her land survey) and is currently taking care of it."

Joey redesigned the system first thing this morning.  I spoke with the customer by phone and sent him the revised design.  He approved it, and docu-signed the PowerClerk document.  Nice save, everyone!"

They love their design and are very excited about the environmental impact.  They are also very happy that we were able to produce nearly 50% of their power since there is a lot of shading around their home.  We well exceeded their expectations!"

They were told they would get bills for $150 a month and receive the difference if there was one, which is completely incorrect. They seem like the will be g2g soon but don't particularly like the look of the panels.

They asked every question under the sun all over again. They claimed they never saw pictures of the footings or the inverter and had concerns about both. After overcoming this they kept saying that I don't know how the tax credits work and that they want to buy. After a long tedious discussion they finally saw the light. I deframed their mindset and reframed our proposal. By the end of the discussion they said we love this and we really want to talk to our tax guy. Upon further probing I then had to deframe and highlight again why buying is not in their best interest. It finally clicked and they they want to do the PPA now. They said all they need to do is see the systems that they received addresses too. 

Unfortunately they wouldn't sign tonight. Fortunately she said you will hear from me by Monday to move forward. She said she wants to reschedule an appointment to sign docs at that time and that she looks forward to seeing me again to sign :)"

We are the first company they have met with and they feel that it would be irresponsible to make a 20 year commitment without educating themselves on the other options, and other companies, in the market.  

They were under the impression that we would be producing 110% of their annual consumption.  The design is producing 87%, which is fantastic, but they are disappointed that we didn't achieve the levels they were told would be possible.  I think that they misunderstood the 110% maximum to be the level they would actually be producing.  

I shared with them the significant savings, as well as the enormous environmental inpact their system will have.  They told me that, at this point, the design itself would be satisfactory, but they want to see a few other proposals before making a final decision.  

They did not want to make a follow up appointment, but they asked us to follow up by phone in two weeks.  We should schedule a follow up call for February 8, 2016."

HQ got him back on the calendar for today.  We redesigned his system using 285 watt panels but are still producing 101% of his power.  He had a couple of residual questions regarding the process of transferring the PPA to a new homeowner, and the extent of our insurance coverage.  Once I addressed those concerns he was ready to move forward.  

Some things are worth the wait.  :)"

They also were worried about being able to sell their house with solar. Tyler and I explain how it is more beneficial to have solar than to not and it will help them sell their house in the future. They still wanted to sit on the 2 design so I will call or text them on Monday to see which design they decided on."

91,Kimberly Gallo,0033900001wo3wYAAQ,Suffolk,2016-01-26 20:37:07.000000,cancel,"There are a few reasons why they would like to cancel. They don't like being locked into a 20 year agreement, they weren't happy with their savings, mainly because they use so much electricity, and the main reason is because they don't want anyone going into their checking account and taking money out. 
I was able to talk through the other concerns, but there their concern for us taking money out is unique. They both are self employeed and sometimes can't pay their electric bill when work has been light. They are able to call PSEG and work it out. With us however it is automatic payments no matter what and if they don't have money in their account for it then they were told we could end up putting a lean on their house, and they definitely don't want that.
For now they don't want to move forward but they really like us and if they change their minds they will let us know."
93,Michelle Perry,0033900001wneWgAAI,Suffolk,2016-01-27 15:41:01.000000,moretime-incomplete,"Met with Mr. Perry.  He is not the homeowner.  Mrs. Perry, the homeowner, was not available to meet today.  She is at work.

Although he is not the homeowner, Mr. Perry says that the decision regarding solar will be primarily his.  They are meeting with 5 companies and intend to compare the programs and designs before making a final decision.  

We are producing 102% of their power, compared with Solar City who is only producing 83% of their power.  He has not yet received designs from the other companies.  All meetings are within the next 10 days.

Mr. Perry was not aware that they would be paying for the monthly production.  It was his understanding that his payment would be the same every month.  He currently pays $189/month to PSEG on balanced billing.  I explained that balanced billing was a false representation of his actual costs, and demonstrated that for 8 out of 12 months his bill from Level Solar would be less than $189 based on the estimated monthly production.  The only time the costs would exceed that number would be in the summer months due to high production that accommodates high consumption during those months.  When I illustrated the annual savings with solar he was extremely disappointed.  He had been led to believe he would be saving thousands of dollars, which is obviously unrealistic.  This led him to suggest that leasing would be the better program for him, but I highlighted several of the disadvantages of leasing and showed him how the costs would actually be higher than with a PPA.  

He was under the impression that the homeowner would receive the utility tax credit in addition to the NYS Tax Credit.  When I shared with him that Level Solar received the utility incentive he got frustrated and said that he wasn't given that information at the initial consultation.  Also, when I explained that he would need to have a tax liability to NYS in order to take advantage of the NYS tax credit he accused me of using the tax credit as a ""marketing ploy"".  I was able to diffuse the situation by showing him that we were actually the only company to be truthful about the tax credit, when all the others had led him to believe he would be able to collect that money as if it were a rebate.

He shared with me that he and his wife plan to sell their home in 3 years when his wife retires.  He was concerned about the transferability of the PPA.  I explained the easy process involved and he was satisfied with that.

At the end of our meeting Mr. Perry said that he was seriously considering Level Solar.  He has a few other meetings in the next 10 days so he asked us to call him to follow up at the end of next week.  

If someone at HQ handles the follow up, please make sure that Michelle Perry will be available for the follow up meeting.  Evidently, the other solar companies told him that, even though he is not the homeowner, he could sign all the required documents.  I explained to him why it was necessary for the homeowner to be present for the meeting, but please reaffirm the importance of this when you speak with him."

I tried to get their offer but it online on their sons email, and they don't have the password and he is also on a cruise right now. They will try to remember to get it to me when he gets back.
They were referred by Leon Delmarco who loves us, and so far they do too :)"

Please add Mrs.Woodley's husband to the account.  His name is Thomas Zatarga."
105,Timothy Armusewicz,0033900001wop2RAAQ,Suffolk,2016-01-28 17:58:11.000000,goodtogo,"This couple was fantastic.  They felt completely comfortable from their first meeting with Josh and had no questions or concerns about the program.  

We had designed the system to work around several vents on the south facing roof.  The homeowner is also a contractor and told me that he would simply move the vents to the north roof so that we could add more panels.  

I called Eduardo and explained the changes to him.  Within minutes, I received a revised design that added 7 panels and increased production from 77% of their consumption to 86%.  They were thrilled with the new design, and with our ability to make revisions so quickly.  They docu-signed the PowerClerk on my iPad and completed all the other documents.  

What could have been a situation that delayed the process by several days, was handled in just a few minutes and the customers are ecstatic!

The customer shared with me that he has an open permit with the Town of Southampton for a front porch he is building.  He is in the process of renewing that permit so please let him know if we encounter any issues so he can resolve them quickly.  

The customer promised to move the vents on the roof within the next few days.  He will text or call me and Josh to us know the obstructions have been removed."

Because he uses 23,000kWh annually, he was anticipating we would produce about 50% of his power.  It turns out we are producing 101%!!  He was shocked, and practically speechless with excitement.  

He had no questions at all.  He said that Josh had been wonderful and addressed all of his concerns from the beginning so now he just wanted to get moving.  

He agreed to write a testimonial for us to use on our website and other media.  He also allowed me to take a photograph of him holding his design.

Richard Kahn's notes had brought to my attention that the customer has several CO issues that he is aware of.  I discussed these with the customer and he intends to legalize all the existing structures.  He has already opened permits for the illegal items, and brought them in to compliance.  He now needs to schedule a final inspection by the Town to legalize them and issue COs.  I assured the customer that we would inform him if we encountered any obstacles when we apply for his permit.

He received the Solar City design, which was producing less power than we proposed.  We are producing 105% of his energy.  

He shared with me that he and his wife discussed both proposals and decided that the savings wasn't worth moving forward.  He wants to wait until solar can reduce his monthly bill by at least $200-$300.  I explained that those numbers are not a realistic expectation, and that in the future, once the tax incentives are reduced, solar rates are likely to increase, rather than decrease.  I also reminded him that the first year savings represents the lowest that his savings will be for the entire 20 years.  

I also shared with him that the financial savings is only one component of massive benefit of solar.  I highlighted the environmental impact, but that is not a consideration for this customer.

Unfortunately, I was not able to change his mind and he has decided to cancel the process and not move forward.  

Josh - Do you want to try to reach out to him?"

They are also looking into going solar with solar city, but they said they feel lot more comfortable with us. We are also able to offset more of their consumption than solar city.

They main reason they can't move forward yet is because they are deciding if they are going to reroof or add another level to their house, which would be a completely different roof design. I gave them the contact info for a new roof to get a quote from our customer I met with a couple days ago.

This couple was highly analytical and took over 2 hours to get G2G but we succeeded.

He still doesn't know how much he'll use in a year but after discussing the energy audit in more depth and comparing to what we can provide, he is excited to have such a big system that produces all of his power. 

His new land survey shows the pool but he isn't sure if it's permitted or not. He was able to get money from the previous owners to pay for the pool permit if needed. Because of this be is not worried if the town asks him to clear it up and will happily comply if they ask him because he already has the money for it from closing on the house.

They are very numbers focused based on the fact that they are both accountants.

Another thing against us was the fact that it's tax season and Mr. Darson and Mr. Darson is an accountant so he couldn't stay long.  Mrs. Darson and I continued to talk and the appointment lasted an hour and a half.  

With both homeowners I did my utmost best to stress our global mission of helping the environment. And also focusing on the fact that the way they are purchasing their electric is from a monopoly that is using a variable pricing system. And also, the company makes them pay more when they use less.  I compared this to a legal mafia.  Mrs. Darison liked this analogy a lot.  I stressed to them that the number of savings is not what's most important.   That also there home value will go up immediately...  I explained that if we come back with a number that was 4 as opposed to 6 for savings then this should not matter because before we met the number for savings was zero.  I explained to Mr. Darson that the smartest investment is an infinite return on your investment, which he will get from our program.  Mr. Darson Agreed.   

After Mr. Darson left to work more on his business I leveraged Level's values to Mrs.  Darison.  I explained to her that we are here to thrive in many more markets and that this is an amazing company to be apart of with a track record of countless euphoric customers.  I advised her to look at our reviews if she hasn't done so yet.

After speaking to Mrs. Darson for an hour about solar/life I did notice a change in heart in her and that before hand she may not have been thinking of all the benefits that solar has to offer.  She agreed to a second appointment with us after the tax season. 

Another faster solution is if we can add more panels to roof 3 or 4 then they will deffinitly go solar with us.  Can we please research more into if this ? I would love to for them to be our next raving fans, and I'm confident we can earn their business."

I explained in a lot of detail why that is beneficial for her and how the bank works. 
She's on balanced billions right now so it took a little longer for her to understand. She also didn't like that her bills would be different because she is retired and has to budget everything. 
After planning everything I think she understands it a lot better and can see how a PPA can work in her best interest.
She is getting her house raised and doesn't want to start anything until shed knows when they are going to do that. Once she figures that out she will call me and let me know to come back for the town docs. She wants to get everything done at one time so she doesn't want to start this process yet."

They shared with me hat they feel as if this program is too good to be true.  They did extensive research, and everything they found supports their impression that the PPA is the best program for them, but they wanted me to reassure them that this was real.  I was able to do so, and we had a really nice conversation about some of the nut and bolt details of how this program works, and why it make sense.

They have a pool, shed, and patio cover that they are looking to get permitted. 

The good news for us is that they want to go solar and are 100% willing to cover cost and work for getting everything legalized. They expressed they are not worried about fees and will pay them.

I went over buy and lease and why a PPA is far better and he finally understood and said he wants to only do the PPA. He was very stuck on going with scty but said he likes us much better now. 

After having AD do a 3rd design change while I was in the home, he finally accepted our proposal. He asked how he can cancel with scty and how we apply for a permit with us.  I told him I'll need to get the letter for him to sign to cancel their permit and we need the power clerk signed but first off he needs to cut down his tree, so I told him to do that as soon as he could. 

I got him to sign town docs for now but will have to go back with the letter and power clerk. He just wanted to talk to scty today before he fully commits with us and said he'd call back in the next couple of days. 

I will personally follow up with him on Friday if he doesn't call me back first. He should be G2G at that time and I will set a time to revisit and finalize everything.

I spent and hour and a half with him trying to get him to get the permitting process going now but he said he is not ready to. He said he has a lot going on and still has to wrap his head around this agreement being too go to be true. He really didn't seem like he wanted to sign anything so I didn't want to force him.

I told them we use more efficient panels and they said Vivint said that too, so I showed them the Vivint plans I have on my google drive. I was able to prove we were able to produce more electricity with less panels even. I mentioned the 2.4% increase vs their 2.9% increase and they told me Vivint is also offering a 2.4% increase now. I told them ours look nicer, especially because of the skirt we out on and apparently Vivint is offering that as well.
They seem to like us but they want to wait and see what Vivint can offer them too. They want to get as far away from PSEG as possible and we obviously use better panels than Vivint so I am sure they will end up as our customer.

A couple things disturbed her. One, she went online to find the best 5 solar companies for her and Level Solar didn't come up.

Also, she went to Rooseveltfield mall a couple times and didn't see anyone at our booth, but did see people at the other solar companies booths, so she was curious about that.

Aside from not being able to make a decision without his wife present, he also expressed that the 20 year commitment was the biggest hold up. Asking him questions about why this was a reservation helped me to determine his logic for saying this. I was able to go over the benefits of solar to avoid the dangers/fears of the volatile, unstable PSEG. This resonated well with him and he agreed, but his wife wasn't there to make the decision without him.

They had looked into solar once before, but with a purchase option, and that company told them it wasn't worth installing on their roof.
They are happy now that we are able to install on their house and offset some of their consumption!"

This was a tough one! I asked what their expectation on savings were and he said if I can't cut my bill in half then it's not worth it. I then did a hard takeaway and told him that solar probably isn't the best thing for them and told him that the max first year is someone that gets 100% of power from solar and may be around 20-25% savings first year. This was shocking to him but he asked me to stay and proceed with what he have to offer. 

I then went over our design of offsetting 37% of their power and asked the reasons for such high usage. After conversing about their usage I showed them the savings and set the expectation that this is step one and that step two would be to reduce usage so they save more money. I gave them pointers on reducing vampire loads and going LED in all lights and this was received very well. After 2 hours of talking they excitedly signed the documents to move forward. 

This was a Vivinit takeaway where they had a bad experience. Let's make sure they receive our classic A+ service going forward. 

Vivint did apply for and receive a permit but the finnerty's just received a notice that it expired so we should be good to go with applying for our permit. 

Vivint also applied for the net meter which has been installed for almost a year now. They are already off balanced billing and know that it will stay that way. 

This is an awesome couple that is excited to do what they can to try and save more. Despite initial concerns of resale value and savings, they now see the long term value of solar and are no longer worried about transferring at time of sale.

He was worried we would tell him he has to pay 100K to buy out the system in the future. I showed him on the PPA that he was emailed that he can buy it out at the fair market value or the declining at 5% a year, and the letter that goes along with the powerclerk telling him the cost of the system. He felt a lot more comfortable with those two things. Now he is excited to go solar and start saving money!"

Since we met those two requirements, he had no other questions or concerns and signed all the documents.  

Before we can move forward, he needs to remove a tree from his backyard.  He told me that he is taking care of this next weekend.  I asked him to send a picture of the tree removed so that we can move forward with the process.  

Since this is a draft design, there was no PowerClerk.  I explained to Mr. Kelly that there would be one more document to sign once the tree is removed.  He would prefer to sign all documents in person, so we will need to scheduled another appointment after the tree is removed.

221,Timothy Grimaldi,0033900001xHlOCAA0,Suffolk,2016-02-17 22:40:31.000000,goodtogo,"This was a 2 hour and 20 minute appointment.  Tim owns a fabrication company and is hyper-focused on numbers.  He spent nearly an hour modeling out our program and comparing it to Solar City who had offered him a fixed rate of $0.21/kWh.  After doing all of the calculations, he proclaimed that our program saved him nearly $8,000 more than Solar City would over the next 20 years.  

He asked every single question I've ever heard from a customer, and shared every single concern I've ever seen.  I initially tried to highlight the benefits, but it was clear that he needed a specific response to each question and concern so we went through them one by one.  

Once I had overcome his questions and concerns, his wife, who he originally said was not joining us, called on the phone and shared another 25 minutes of questions and concerns.  Ultimately, she admitted that her primary concern is the appearance of the panels.  At this point Tim began presenting his ideas for manufacturing a product that would conceal solar panels from view.  

After an exhaustive conversation that addressed every topic I've ever experienced since I began working here, Tim decided that we were the best option for him.  

Tim asked me to convey his desire to meet with Richard one on one to discuss his ideas for manufacturing a product that would conceal solar panels on the roof.  I explained that I did not have the authority to speak for the company, so he said he is going to call HQ in the coming days so that he can arrange ""15 minutes"" in front of Richard.  I will say that Tim's ideas are intriguing and worth listening to.  

Tim pays all of his bills from an account that is managed by his assistant.  He does not have access to the bank account information.  He promised to call HQ tomorrow and provide the information we need for ACH.

Submit permits, please.  :)"

Come to find out the front roof is more efficient. Once they finally got comfortable with the design on the front they had a problem with us not putting panels on the front and back to get them to 100% of their usage. Harvest solar was going to put 75 panels on front and back to get them to what they need, so they thought,why shouldn't we? It was nice to prove to them we don't need to put that many on to get what they need, but they did not want to move forward unless we covered 100% of their usage. Thank you Eduardo for dealing with me constantly calling during this appointment and getting them what they asked for so they would be g2g!"

I think I was able to overcome the competitive situations by showing him our competitors' contracts on my ipad. He just would like to talk to his wife about it before making any final decisions.

I have had several customers tell me they would like to see the contract before making any decisions.

235,Debra Mills,0033900001xGwgzAAC,Suffolk,2016-02-18 20:57:09.000000,moretime-incomplete,"I met with Mr. and Mrs. Mills.  They were disappointed that they will not be receiving 100% of their power.  They had expected that would be the case.  I explained that 100% coverage is not typical and that the 63% they are receiving is actually fantastic.  I shared the financial and environmental benefits, and highlighted the enormous impact their system will have on their economic stability, and the local environment.  They conceded that there are sizable benefits, but reaffirmed that we did not meet their expectations.

We had a discussion regarding PSEG rates.  Mrs. Mills says that she does not think that PSEG rates are likely to increase very much in the future.  I shared with her the historic trends and we all agreed that, in cases like this, history tends to accurately predict the future.

They met with Vivint last week, and want to delay a final decision until they have had the opportunity to compare both proposals.  Ultimately, they want to choose the company who is able to provide the highest percentage of their annual energy consumption.  I shared with them the fact that, because Vivint's rates increase more quickly than ours do, even if they were to produce slightly more energy, the savings would still be less over 20 years.  They agreed that this is likely, but they don't feel comfortable making a decision without seeing both proposals.  

I obtained the rafter photos that were not taken at the initial sale, and am uploading them to Box.  I scheduled a follow up call next Friday if we haven't heard from them by then."

While I was there we made a list of things they can do do help reduce their consumption. They are going to look into trimming their tree directly south of their house to increase the efficiency of their panels. After doing that and decreasing their consumption they plan to evaluate how much they will still need to get from PSEG and might ask for the neighbor to remove their tree if they still need more from solar, and we could add another 8 panel system to their house.

When I arrived I discovered the craziest thing, this was a formerly sold customer  of ours that Steven Elliott sold last July! For whatever reason John never heard from us and cancelled to go with Vivint who knocked on his door, after Molly obtained a G2G in August.  He went through Vivint's entire process and almost got installed with them. They showed up to install and they wouldn't do it because a shingle was missing on his roof. John was not happy so he cancelled with them. He has since had his roof repaired. 

Now a few months later, By pure luck, our very own Kimberly Gillman cold called him and set this as a sales appointment. Little did she know he was already signed up with us last year. 
After asking John what was going on and finding out the details, I made a call to Len first then Amy. Between all of us we figured out what needed to be done and Len and AD redesigned with 285w panels Within 20 minutes while I was in John's home and sent me everything I needed to get signed via Docusign.

I got a permit cancellation letter, a consent form, and a power clerk all signed with 285w panels and he wants to be installed ASAP!! 

This required serious agility of our team and I was able to resell John and do a cad visit all at the same time lol. 

Since we already submitted a permit to the town, Amy is going to see if we can just do a change order with the town. If we can't then I'll go get town docs signed Monday. I'm still putting this as a G2G because of the situation and the chance that our current permit will still work. Hope everyone is okay with that.

Howard asked me to email him a copy of the PPA so that he and his family can review the terms of the agreement. Once they have done so, he will contact me with additional questions. When they are ready, I will meet with the family in person. I suspect this will require a full sales presentation to the family as well.

We talked for an extended period of time and the biggest holdup they kept expressing was the aesthetics of the system on their big beautiful home. Showing them pics of the Natolis massive home in Bohemia, with solar all over, eased them up a lot. 

Steve's wife was funny and said it took him 8 years to propose to her and that he makes decisions slowly. I was able to solve all of his concerns and answer all questions but he asked for one week to think about it. He expressed that he is adamate on spending a few hours in silence pondering his options and choice. I think their is also a lot of anxiety being the first one to get solar on their street. Luckily his wife was good to go despite her disdain for aesthetics, so I think she will also be able to sway Steve to pull the trigger. 

We will speak next Tuesday for his final decision. I will personally be in touch with him. 

Jonathan, please hold me accountable to following up with him on Tuesday.

They use a lot of electricity because that's how they heat their house. He was happy getting just over 6,000kWh of productions because we were able to add 4 more panels to his design.

Jim and Cara were a very cool couple. They are so excited to be going solar. They loved that we are giving them 103% and that their system will be symmetrical and perfect. This will be a great install to showcase when completed. 

Jim got home after I explained everything to Cara so while he was gone she expressed how Jim was very skeptical because of his friend that got solar and had a horrible experience. She said they had such major leaking and flooding issues that it resulted in them having to gut the entire living room and repair all walls, floors and replace furniture. She also told me that they dropped a ladder on top of their friends new truck and did an illegal electrical job that they were trying to get away with. That company has since been bought out by NRG. 

When Jim got home he shared the same story and was naturally very hesitant for good reason, but I reassured him that our quality is top notch, that we don't cut corners, that we do everything legal and by the book and that our work has to comply to pass inspection, also that we don't sub contract anything, our installers and electricians are the best in the business and do the cleanest jobs, and that our systems look amazing! I also hyped up our permitting process, our customer service, referral program, etc.
 
By the end of that they were super stoked to go solar and Jim has 2 of his friends at Petro that will be calling Richard Kahn for solar. 

The only other thing Jim wanted to make sure of is that we aren't instilling in the cold weather. He doesn't want his shingles to crack in the cold weather. I told him that the permit will take about 6 weeks anyway (putting them into April) before we can even install. He was okay with this and said April or May install is perfect.  

We are lucky to have such amazing customers. Lets make sure this install goes flawlessly."

1)he needs to check with his accountant to make sure he can capture both tax credits
2)he is just now finishing the construction of his home and plans to move in my March 15th.

He shared many of the same concerns he did at our initial consultation.  He is extremely apprehensive about making a final decision on any home improvement until his divorce is farther along.  I can personally relate to the situation he is in, so we spent some time discussing the options, including moving forward with applying for building permits so that he could lock in to the rates, but delaying the installation by several months.  

Ultimately, Anthony is much too uncomfortable in his current situation to make a decision about solar.  He wants to go solar, and clearly articulated the benefits and value the solar would bring for him, but he is under too much pressure from forces beyond his control to move forward right now.  

We scheduled a follow up appointment for Wednesday, April 13, 2016 at 6pm.  We are going to stay in touch between now and then in the hopes that he will be ready to move forward sooner.  

With some extra attention, and respecting the space and time he needs to make a decision, we will be able to help Anthony become a member of the Level Solar family.

They were disappointed with the level of savings at 44% production, but I highlighted the enormous benefits including the environmental impact and they agreed that those were compelling reasons to move forward.  

The obstacle to moving forward is that they have an illegal pool and deck and want to research the cost of legalizing those structures before they move forward.  I shared with them my belief that these kinds of issues are going to inhibit their ability to make any significant improvements to their home, so it is best to proactively address them now.  They agreed, but don't want us to apply for permits until they have determined the cost of resolving these issues.

Their roof has 5 layers of shingles though so they have to get a new roof in order for us to install. He also will look into trimming/taking down trees so we can add more panels in the future when they get a new roof.

I arrived with two designs. The first one is what we could actually do, the second one is what would be possible if trees were removed. 

After much deliberation over nearly 2 hours, they decided that they didn't want either design. The reason is because they can't control the removal of the back tree in their neighbors yard. 

They would like us to do another design assuming only the one tree in the front is removed and the back tree staying. Essentially we need to mesh the two designs together by designing for the entire front roof covered with the proposed 29 panels on one design and the proposed 13 panels on the back roof on the other design. If we can do this they would be happy to move forward. 

They both did mention some apprehension with the way our system looks. They stopped by the 3 homes that Elliott told them to visit and they were very disappointed with the way our system looks. They thought the raised clamps in between our panels were ugly and they also hated how they could see the footings from the side. I told them that we could easily paint the footings that show on the side. This was a satisfactory solution to them, but they just hate the look of them being bumpy looking because of our mounts. They said they liked the smooth look of solar city's panels better. After showing them lots of pictures of our installs, they felt they all looked really nice.  The one home they visited in person just made them hate the look of our system. I think they are okay with it now after I told them how clean our electrical work is, how we use a more efficient panel, how we use black mono panels instead of the bluish colored poly panels. They like these features a lot and said they could live with our system if we can paint the visible footings black and paint the conduit to match the roof shingles.

Please do a redesign and put them back on the calendar for March 16th @ 6pm. This was the earliest that they can meet again due to vacation and two weddings for family members."

Really great family and very happy to be going solar. They have been told they didn't qualify by other solar companies so they were happy we could do it. Theyve wanted to go solar for so long and their kids are even excited. Their daughter just did a report in school on solar. 

They also have another home they run their veterinarian business out of that they want to put solar on. They are in the process of closing the mortgage on it and will call Kahn when they own it so they can get solar installed.

They use very little electricity as it is so they were wrestling with the decision if it's worth getting panel that they don't like the look of, and not getting a huge savings. And they do realize that they use very little electricity too. They finally decided it is worth it,it is good for the environment and is going to save them some money.

He was really cool and very willing to cut every tree down. He just told me whatever ones we tell him to remove he'll have it done in 2 weeks. 

He is also moving his roof vents and removing his satellite dish so he can get more panels. He is being deployed with the Air Force to Africa in May and wants everything set up before he leaves so he's anxious to get this taken care of ASAP. 

I told him we'd send more info on what to remove. Unfortunately it was so dark that I couldn't get good pictures but with the satellite pics Eduardo gave us James knew exactly which ones to get rid of.
